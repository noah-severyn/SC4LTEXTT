# SC4LTEXTT : SC4 LTEXT Translator
An assistant for translating Simcity 4 [LTEXT](https://wiki.sc4devotion.com/index.php?title=LTEXT) files.

To use, select a file containing the LTEXT files you wish to translate. Choose the language you wish to translate to, and translate each of the LTEXT files. They will turn yellow in the list once they are translated. The text in the translation output area can be manually changed if desired. Currently the only supported operation is saving the LTEXT files to a new .dat file. Only the translated files will be saved to the new file, and the Group in the TGI will be incremented by the appropriate offset for the chosen language. Currently all LTEXT files are written uncompressed.

The translation uses the Azure AI Text Translation service, so an internet connection is required to translate.

Numerous improvements to come.
